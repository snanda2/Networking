Layers Of OSI Model
===================

There are 7 Layers of OSI Model.

1. Application Layer (Human Computer interaction layer where application can access network services)

2. Peresentation Layer (Ensure that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs)

3. Session Layer (Maintaining connection and is responsible for controlling ports and session)

4. Transport Layer (Transimts data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP)

5. Network Layer (Decides which physical data path will take)

6. Data Layer(Defines the format of data on the network)

7. Physical Layer (Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium)
