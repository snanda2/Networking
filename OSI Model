OSI Model
==========

- OSI Model stands for Open System Interconnection.
- OSI Model started in 1976 by ISO(International Standard Organizaton).
- And created on 1986. 
- OSI model acts as a reference model and is not implemented on the Internet because of its late invention. The current model being used is the TCP/IP model. 
- we consider this as Reference Model.

Layers Of OSI Model
===================

There are 7 Layers of OSI Model.

1. Application Layer (Human Computer interaction layer where application can access network services)

2. Peresentation Layer (Ensure that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs)

3. Session Layer (Maintaining connection and is responsible for controlling ports and session)

4. Transport Layer (Transimts data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP)

5. Network Layer (Decides which physical data path will take)

6. Data Layer(Defines the format of data on the network)

7. Physical Layer (Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium)


Application Layer
=================
- User works on this Application Layer.
- These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. 
- This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user.
- If you want to send an email to anyone you use gmail for that. So the Gmaail will work on Application Layer.
- HTTP, Telnet, FTP will work on this layer.

Example - Gmail, Facebook, Browser, Messanger

Presentation Layer
==================
- The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer.
- The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.
- Data encrytion and decryption is done in this layer

Example for the presentation Layer
Let's think I have two files a.mp3 and a.txt when we double click on the a.mp3 file and try to open that file, the file will open in some mp3 player
and if we will double click on the a.txt file that will open on a notepad. So who decides where the file will open and where to represent so the answer is
the extension and this is controlled in the Presentation Layer.
